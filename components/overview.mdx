Asteroid provides tools to build robust AI applications with supervision and evaluation capabilities. By integrating projects, tasks, runs, supervision functions, the `@supervise` decorator, and custom supervisors, you can create AI systems that are controllable, testable, and can involve human oversight.

This section provides an overview of the main components of the Asteroid, along with code examples to illustrate their usage:
- [Projects, Tasks and Runs](/components/projects_tasks_runs.mdx)
- [@supervise Decorator](/components/supervise_decorator.mdx)
- [Supervisors](/supervisors/overview.mdx)
