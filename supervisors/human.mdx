To involve human oversight in your application's decision-making process, you can use the `human_supervisor`. This supervisor escalates decisions to a human reviewer.

### Using `human_supervisor`

Here's how you can use the `human_supervisor` in your `@supervise` decorator:

```python
from asteroid_sdk.supervision.supervisors import human_supervisor

@supervise(
    supervision_functions=[
        [human_supervisor(timeout=300)]  # Waits up to 300 seconds for human decision
    ]
)
def sensitive_action(data):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

When the `sensitive_action` function is called, it will pause execution until a human reviewer approves or rejects the action via the Asteroid supervision interface.
