If you'd prefer to run one of our example agents, please see [Cookbook](/cookbook)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the `asteroid-sdk` Python SDK:

    ```bash
    pip install asteroid-sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an API key">
    Sign in to https://platform.asteroid.ai, head to `API Keys` and generate a new key. 
    
    See [API Keys](/api_keys) for more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialise Asteroid">
    Before your agent starts running, you need to initialise Asteroid:
    ```python
    init_code
    ```
    See more about initialisation [here](/components/projects_tasks_runs).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wrap your LLM client">
    After initialising Asteroid, you need to wrap your LLM client; simply initialise your normal LLM client, then use Asteroids provided wrappers:
    ```python
    wrap code
    ```
    Find out more about the @supervise decorator [here](/components/supervise_decorate), and which supervisors are possible [here](/supervisors/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and control agent via the platform">
    Inspect the agents execution and respond to any human review requests in the interface.

    Navigate to https://platform.asteroid.ai and click `Projects` --> `Tasks` --> `Runs` and click on the latest run.
