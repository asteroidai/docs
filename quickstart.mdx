The easiest way to get started is to head to our platform and run a workflow from there: [https://platform.asteroid.ai](https://platform.asteroid.ai)

If you want to run a workflow from your own code, you can follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an API key">
    Sign in to [https://platform.asteroid.ai](https://platform.asteroid.ai), head to **API Keys** and generate a new key.

    ```bash
    export ASTEROID_API_KEY="ast..."
    ``` 
    
    See [API Keys](/api_keys) for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your SDK">
    We provide SDKs for both TypeScript and Python. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

    - [TypeScript SDK](/sdk/typescript)
    - [Python SDK](/sdk/python)

    Each SDK page contains detailed documentation and examples to help you get started.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once you've set up your environment, you can:

1. Create your first workflow using the platform UI
2. Follow the examples in the SDK documentation
