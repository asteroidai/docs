We maintain a repository of example agents that use Asteroid for supervision. You can find them on our GitHub: https://github.com/asteroidai/cookbook.

To run an example, follow these simple steps: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Cookbook repo">
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/asteroidai/cookbook
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick an example">
    For example, you could pick the `openai_tools_quickstart` example:
    ```bash
      cd openai_quickstart
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Recommended) Create a new environment">
    For example, if you're using Conda:
    ```bash
      conda create -n asteroid
      conda activate asteroid
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install requirements">
    ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get an API Key">
    Sign in https://platform.asteroid.ai and generate an API key, then set it with:
    ```bash
      export ASTEROID_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    ```
    See [API Keys](/api_keys) for more information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    ```bash
      python run.py
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Check on your agent in the platform">
    Navigate to https://platform.asteroid.ai and find your agent in the interface
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You've now run an agent that uses Asteroid for supervision.
